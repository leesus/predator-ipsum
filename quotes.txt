This cabinet minister, does he always travel on the wrong side of the border?
Dillon!... You son of a bitch!
What's the matter? The CIA got you pushin' too many pencils?
What is this fucking tie business?
We're a rescue team, not assassins.
My team always works alone, you know that.
This is getting better by the minute.
Knock-knock.
Stick around!
You set us up! It was bullshit, all of it!
So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us in the meat grinder. What happened to you Dillon? You used to be somebody I could trust.
My men are not expendable. And I don't do this kind of work.
She's your baggage. You fall behind, and you're on your own.
You still don't understand, Dillon, do you? Whatever it is out there, it killed Hopper, and now it wants us.
If it bleeds, we can kill it.
Bleed, bastard.
Leave it. He didn't kill you because you were unarmed. No sport...
You're one, ugly... motherfucker.
...Bad idea.
Come on... Come on! Do it! Do it! Come on! Kill me! I'm here! Come on! Do it now! Kill me!
Run! Go! Get to the chopper!
We move. Five meter spread. No sound.
You never were that smart...
She'll give away our position any chance she gets. No deal.
Heat seekers Dillon. Pretty sophisticated for a bunch of half-assed mountain boys...
What's got Billy so spooked?
We make a stand now, or there will be nobody left to go to the chopper.
You lose it here and you're in a world of hurt.
Bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here. This stuff will make you a god damned sexual Tyrannosaurus, just like me.
Payback time...
Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick.
This place makes Cambodia look like Kansas.
I ain't got time to bleed...
Come on in, you fuckers... Come on in... "Ol'Painless" is waiting...
Ain't no way for no soldier to die.
You're ghostin' us, motherfucker. I don't care who you are back in the world, you give away our position one more time, I'll bleed ya, real quiet. Leave ya here. Got that?
If these were central American then I'm a god damn chinaman.
Anytime...
SEEEERRRRGEEAAAANT!!!
I gotcha, motherfucker! I gotcha!
Long tall Sally, she's built for speed, she got everythin' that Uncle John need. Aw, I'm gonna have me some fun. I'm gonna have me some fun. I'm gonna have me some fun...
He was... My friend.
Here we are again bro... Just you and me. Same kind of moon, same kind of jungle. Real number ten, remember... Whole platoon, thirty-two men chopped into meat... We walk out, just you and me, nobody else. Right on top, huh? Not a scratch... Not a fuckin' scratch. You know whoever got you, he'll come back again. And when he does I'm gonna cut your name, right into him... I'm gonna cut your name, right into him!
I see you...
Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
That's a real nasty habit you got there.
Showtime, kid.
Goddamn jackpot. This is more than we ever thought we'd get. We finally got those bastards. We got 'em!
I woke up. Why don't you? You're an asset, an expendable asset and I used you to get the job done. Got it?
You saying that Blain and Hawkins were killed by a fucking lizard? That's a bullshit psyche job. There is 2 to 3 men out there at the most. Fucking lizard.
So, what are you gonna try next? Cheese?
I'm gonna have me some fun.
I was going down on my girlfriend and said 'Sheesh, you got a big pussy. Sheesh, you got a big pussy.' And she said, 'Why did you say that twice?' And I said 'I didn't.' You know...it was the echo."
When I was little, we found a man. He looked like... like, butchered. The old woman in the village crossed themselves... and whispered crazy things - strange things. "El Diablo que hace trofeos de los hombres." Only in the hottest years this happens - and this year, it grows hot. We begin finding our men. We found them sometimes without their skins... and sometimes much, much worse. ..."El Diablo que hace trofeos de los hombres" means "the demon who makes trophies of men".
There's something out there waiting for us... and it ain't no man. We're all gonna die.
Strap this in your sore ass, Blain!
Good old days.
This is a one way ticket. Once we cross that border... We're on our own.
You're hurt. You're bleeding, man. I ain't got time to bleed. Oh, okay... you got time to duck?
What the hell ARE you?
What the hell are YOU?
Maybe you better put her on a leash, agent man.
Stick around!
